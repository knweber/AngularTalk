## What is Angular?
* JavaScript framework
* Isolates an application's responsibilities from each other

## Angular's Structure
* Controller: stores data (state, behavior)
* View
* Directives
  * Custom HTML that can be used to manipulate the DOM
  * Examples: attaching a click handler, appending items to a list
## High Level View

2. Write logic for the click event in the controller
3. Controller passes data to the view
4. View uses directives to manipulate DOM
